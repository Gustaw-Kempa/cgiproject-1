# Smart Service Project CGI Team 1 - Power Predict

Welcome to the ! This repository contains the code and datasets for a student project aimed at developing a smart service solution to predict the number of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations per postal code and estimate their average energy consumption. This README file will guide you through the project, its objectives, and the structure of the repository.

## Project Overview

The Smart Service Project focuses on leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the demand for EV charging stations and estimate their energy consumption at a postal code level. By understanding the charging station requirements and expected energy usage, this solution aims to assist in the planning and optimization of charging infrastructure.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```kotlin
├── models/
│   ├── model_1.py
│   ├── model_2.py
│   └── ...
├── datasets/
│   ├── raw_data/
│   │   ├── charging_stations.csv
│   │   └── postal_code_data.csv
│   └── processed_data/
│       ├── cleaned_data.csv
│       ├── feature_engineered_data.csv
│       └── train_test_data.csv
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

- `data/`: This directory contains the project's datasets. The `raw_data/` folder holds the raw input data files, including `charging_stations.csv` and `postal_code_data.csv`. The `processed_data/` directory contains the cleaned, feature-engineered, and split train-test datasets (`cleaned_data.csv`, `feature_engineered_data.csv`, and `train_test_data.csv`, respectively).

- `models/`: This directory contains the code for the predictive models developed in the project. Each model is implemented in a separate Python file (e.g., `model_1.py`, `model_2.py`). You can find more details and instructions for running the models in the corresponding files.

- `notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk you through various stages of the project. The `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook provides an analysis of the datasets, while the `data_preparation.ipynb` notebook covers the steps for cleaning and feature engineering. The `model_training.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to train and evaluate the predictive models. Feel free to explore other notebooks as well.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies the files and directories to be ignored by Git version control. It typically includes files that are generated during the development process, such as temporary files or IDE-specific settings.

- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading. It serves as an overview and guide for the project.
